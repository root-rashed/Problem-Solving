## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is my personal log of consistent problem-solving practice. Every day I solve problems from various competitive programming platforms and push my solutions here. The goal is to sharpen algorithmic thinking, strengthen DSA fundamentals, and build a strong problem-solving habit over time.

**Language used:**  C and C++
